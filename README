Cheatsh33ts

This repository contains my personal collection of Linux command-line cheatsheets. Each cheatsheet 
is designed to be used with the cheat tool, which provides quick access to command references 
directly from the terminal.

About the cheat Tool

The cheat tool allows users to create and view interactive cheatsheets for frequently used commands. 
It's especially useful for system administrators and developers who need quick reminders of command 
options without digging through documentation.

You can install cheat on Debian-based systems via Snap:

snap install cheat

snap info cheat

This will display details about the package:

  It was designed to help remind *nix system administrators of options for commands  
  that they use frequently, but not frequently enough to remember.

Cheatsheets Included

Many of the cheatsheets in this repository include ASCII art for a bit of extra flair, 
but feel free to modify them as needed.

For reference, I've included a syntax.cheatsheet.txt file, which outlines the general 
structure for creating cheatsheet headers. These headers allow you to search, reference, 
and parse specific sections of a cheatsheet directly from the terminal.

This repo contains personal cheatsheets that I have created for various linux tasks on 
the command line. All of the cheatsheets are compatible and used with the 'cheat' tool,
which is available both on github as well as on debian based systems with snap. In fact,
if you run 'snap info cheat' in the terminal, this is what you will see:

$snap info cheat
name:      cheat

I have taken the liberty to add ascii art to most of the cheatsheets but feel free to
make changes to them. I have included a cheatsheet called, 'syntax.cheatsheet.txt' that
shows you the general syntax for creating the header for cheatsheets, which allows
you to reference, search and parse sheets or parts of them from the terminal. For
a better understanding of how to use cheat, create your own cheatsheets and change the
chroma colorschemes, visit the github page:
