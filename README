This repo contains personal cheatsheets that I have created for various linux tasks on 
the command line. All of the cheatsheets are compatible and used with the 'cheat' tool,
which is available both on github as well as on debian based systems with snap. In fact,
if you run 'snap info cheat' in the terminal, this is what you will see:

$snap info cheat
name:      cheat
summary:   cheat allows to create and view interactive cheatsheets on the command-line.

  cheat allows you to create and view interactive cheatsheets on the command-line.
  It was designed to help remind *nix system administrators of options for commands
  that they use frequently, but not frequently enough to remember.
  Source comes from https://github.com/cheat

I have taken the liberty to add ascii art to most of the cheatsheets but feel free to
make changes to them. I have included a cheatsheet called, 'syntax.cheatsheet.txt' that
shows you the general syntax for creating the header for cheatsheets, which allows
you to reference, search and parse sheets or parts of them from the terminal. For
a better understanding of how to use cheat, create your own cheatsheets and change the
chroma colorschemes, visit the github page:
