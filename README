<h2>Cheatsh33ts</h2>
<p>This repository contains my personal collection of Linux command-line cheatsheets. Each cheatsheet 
is designed to be used with the cheat tool, which provides quick access to command references 
directly from the terminal.</p>

<h2>About the cheat Tool</h2>

The cheat tool allows users to create and view interactive cheatsheets for frequently used commands. 
It's especially useful for system administrators and developers who need quick reminders of command 
options without digging through documentation.

You can install cheat on Debian-based systems via Snap:

snap install cheat

snap info cheat

This will display details about the package:

  cheat allows you to create and view interactive cheatsheets on the command-line.  
  It was designed to help remind *nix system administrators of options for commands  
  that they use frequently, but not frequently enough to remember.  
  Source comes from https://github.com/cheat  

<h2>Cheatsheets Included</h2>

Many of the cheatsheets in this repository include ASCII art for a bit of extra flair, 
but feel free to modify them as needed.

<h3>Android Debug Bridge - (ADB)</h3>

For reference, I've included a syntax.cheatsheet.txt file, which outlines the general 
structure for creating cheatsheet headers. These headers allow you to search, reference, 
and parse specific sections of a cheatsheet directly from the terminal.
