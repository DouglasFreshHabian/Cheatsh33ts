<h2>Cheatsh33ts</h2>
<p>This repository contains my personal collection of Linux command-line cheatsheets. Each cheatsheet 
is designed to be used with the cheat tool, which provides quick access to command references 
directly from the terminal.</p>

<h2>About the Cheat Tool</h2>

It's especially useful for system administrators and developers who need quick reminders of command 
options without digging through documentation.</p>

<p>📌 Pin this to your notes</p>
<p>For reference, I've included a syntax.cheatsheet.txt file, which outlines the general 
structure for creating cheatsheet headers. These headers allow you to search, reference, 
and parse specific sections of a cheatsheet directly from the terminal.</p>
